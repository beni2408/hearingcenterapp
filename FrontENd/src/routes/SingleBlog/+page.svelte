            1. Keep Your Hearing Aids On Through Security
          </h3>
          <p>
            Good news: you can wear your hearing aids through airport security without removing them. Modern devices do not interfere with scanners, and TSA agents are trained to work with passengers who use hearing technology. If you prefer, you can let the agent know you’re wearing hearing aids, but it’s not required. Keeping them on also ensures you don’t miss important announcements or instructions.

            2. Pack a Travel Kit With Essentials
          </h3>
          <p class="mb-3">
            A dedicated hearing aid travel kit can make a world of difference. Be sure to include items such as:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
            <li>Extra batteries or your charging case</li>
            <li>A cleaning cloth and small brush</li>
            <li>Wax guards</li>
            <li>Drying capsules or a portable dehumidifier</li>
            <li>A hard-shell case</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="mt-3">
            Store this kit in your carry-on, not your checked luggage, so you have everything you need on hand if delays or changes occur.

            3. Bring Backup Power
          </h3>
          <p>
            Flights and layovers can be unpredictable. If you use rechargeable hearing aids, make sure they’re fully charged before you leave and bring your charger, charging cable, and a power bank. For battery-powered devices, pack more batteries than you think you’ll need. Temperature changes and long travel days can drain power faster than usual.

            4. Use Accessibility Tools While in the Airport
          </h3>
          <p>
            Airports are full of noise and movement, making it easy to miss gate announcements or boarding changes. Many airports now offer visual display boards, captioned announcements, and assistance services. If you’re unsure, check the airport’s website or stop by the customer service desk. You can also download your airline’s app for real-time alerts and boarding updates.

            5. Stay Comfortable During Takeoff and Landing
          </h3>
          <p>
            Changes in air pressure can sometimes cause discomfort, especially for passengers with hearing loss. While hearing aids themselves don’t typically worsen pressure changes, you can ease discomfort by yawning, swallowing, chewing gum, or using specialized earplugs designed for pressure regulation. If you experience ongoing pain, talk with your hearing care provider before your trip.

            6. Protect Your Devices on the Plane
          </h3>
          <p>
            When on board, you can continue wearing your hearing aids throughout the entire flight—even during takeoff and landing. Just be cautious when adjusting headrests, neck pillows, or face masks, which can sometimes dislodge devices. If you choose to remove your hearing aids for a nap, store them in their case so they don’t get lost in the seat or fall to the floor.

            7. Don’t Hesitate to Ask for Help
          </h3>
          <p>
            Airline staff are familiar with assisting travelers who use hearing devices. Whether you need help confirming an announcement, understanding instructions, or boarding early for extra time, the crew is there to support you.
